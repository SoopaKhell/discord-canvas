To paint on the Canvas, you can use the following command:

```p 0 0 Black```

The above command will place a black (0, 0, 0) pixel at the coordinates (0, 0) (The top-left most pixel). The board is 100x100, but it begins at (0, 0), so it ends at (99, 99).

```p 99 99 Black```

This command will place a black pixel in the bottom-right most pixel (99, 99).

RGB values may also be used (For example: "255 0 0", or 
"255 0 9", etc).
Use wikipedia's color list to find the color you want. All names from this list are usable:

```p 42 42 Apricot```
On colors with spaces, use dashes (-) instead. (Case does not matter)
